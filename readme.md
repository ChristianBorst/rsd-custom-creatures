# Custom creatures for Ready Set Dice

This will be a basic overview of how to setup a custom repository for your use with Ready Set Dice.

For creating creatures, we've opted to use an already existing tool, namely, monster.pf2.tools

Using their JSON format, simple add the creatures to a repo like this and use the URL within Ready Set Dice.
Note, only you and your party will be able to use these creatures, unless you share the URL with others.

## THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
